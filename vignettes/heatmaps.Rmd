# heatmaps

## Flexible plotting of Functional Genomics data + Sequence features

This package provides simple functions for plotting heatmaps over sets 
of genomic windows. 

This vignette is an example workflow using ChIP-seq data
in zebrafish: the *User Guide* contains detailed information on the package
internals if you want fine-grained control of your plots or to develop tools
which use parts of the package.

First things first, load the `heatmaps` package:

```{r load_heatmaps, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(heatmaps)
```

## Reading in Data

`heatmaps` is written using  core Bioconductor packages, so reading in data can
be easily accomplished with the standard tools. 

Here we read in a set of zebrafish promoters from a 30% Epiboly (30p) embryo,
defined using CAGE data, and corresponding H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data:

```{r data_1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rtracklayer)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(BSgenome.Drerio.UCSC.danRer7)

heatmaps_file = function(fn) system.file("extdata", fn, package="heatmaps")

zf_30p_promoters = import(heatmaps_file("30pEpi_proms.bed"), genome=seqinfo(Drerio))

h3k4me3_30p_pos = readRDS(heatmaps_file("H3K4me3_30p_pos.rds"))
h3k4me3_30p_neg = readRDS(heatmaps_file("H3K4me3_30p_neg.rds"))
h3k4me3_30p = h3k4me3_30p_pos + h3k4me3_30p_neg
```

## Plotting Functional Genomics Data

Many kinds of functional genomics data, such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq or
DNase-seq can be visualised as 'coverage' tracks. In UCSC, these would
be wig, bigWig or bedGraph files.

First, we need to create our windows. We can create another `GRanges` object
which contains 500bp either side of our promoters, using the `promoters`
function in `GenomicRanges`. Unfortunately, some of the resulting ranges
go off the end of a chromosome and so must be dropped: this is done
by testing the width of the trimmed object.

The `CoverageHeatmap` function creates a heatmap object from a `GRanges` object
or an `RleList`. If we are using a `GRanges` object then the weight
can be specified. Internally, this is passed to the `coverage` function from
`GenomicRanges`. In the example we are working with `RleList`s, which are
returned by the `coverage` function.

All heatmaps contain a `coords` slot, which lets `plotHeatmap` know how to
plot the co-ordinates on the x-axis: very often, our plots will be centered
on some feature rather than starting from zero on the x axis. The `label`
slot is optional, and is displayed in the top left-hand corner of the plot
by default, if present.

```{r coverage_heatmap}
coords=c(-500, 500)

windows_30p = promoters(zf_30p_promoters, -coords[1], coords[2])
windows_30p = windows_30p[width(trim(windows_30p)) == 1000]
h3k4me3_30p_heatmap = CoverageHeatmap(
    windows_30p, 
    h3k4me3_30p, 
    coords=coords, 
    label="H3K4me3 30p")

```

The `plotHeatmapList` function will plot the returned heatmap object to the
active device. This function also allows multiple plots to be plotted at the
same time, and sets the device margins. It is usually easier to `plotHeatmapList`
rather than `plotHeatmap` directly.

Options for plotting can be passed to `plotHeatmapList` function. Here, we set
the label text size (`cex.label`) to be smaller than the default, and use the
default color scheme from `RColorBrewer`. A complete list of color schemes is
available using the command `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()`, or on the
[ColorBrewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org/).

```{r plot_coverage_heatmap, fig.height=6, fig.width=3}
plotHeatmapList(h3k4me3_30p_heatmap, cex.label=1, color="Greens")
```

Another way of visualising this signal is using a meta-region plot. This
is effectively just a sum over the 'columns' of a heatmap.

```{r plot_meta, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
plotHeatmapMeta(h3k4me3_30p_heatmap)
```

We can see from this picture that there is an enrichment of H3K4me3 signal
downstream of the promoters. It appears to have some kind of phase, but
it's not very clear what's happening.

If we subtract negative strand reads from positive strand reads, a better
picture starts to emerge.

It is very easy to specify custom color schemes in `heatmaps`. If a
vector of colors is supplied (in any format R understands), then
they are interpolated by `colorRamp`.

When we are using non-obvious color schemes, it can help to plot a
legend describing the value of the colors. This is handled automatically
by `plotHeatmapList` if the option `legend=TRUE` is set.

```{r subtracted, fig.height=6, fig.width=4}
h3k4me3_30p_subtracted = h3k4me3_30p_pos - h3k4me3_30p_neg

h3k4me3_30p_subtracted_hm = CoverageHeatmap(
    windows_30p, 
    h3k4me3_30p_subtracted, 
    coords=coords, 
    label="Phase")

scale(h3k4me3_30p_subtracted_hm) = c(-150, 150)

plotHeatmapList(h3k4me3_30p_subtracted_hm, cex.label=1.5, color=c("red", "white", "blue"), legend=TRUE, legend.width=0.3)
```

## Plotting Sequence Features

`heatmaps` also contains convenient functions to plot sequence features, such as
kmer content or PWM matches, or genomic windows.

First we extract the sequence associated with our windows:

```{r get_seq}
seq_30p = getSeq(Drerio, windows_30p)
```

Now we can use the function `PatternHeatmap` to extract patterns from our sequence.
We can specify either kmers, including ambiguity codes, or using PWMs.

```{r pattern_heatmap, fig.height=6, fig.width=3}
ta_30p = PatternHeatmap(seq_30p, "TA", coords=coords)
plotHeatmapList(ta_30p)
```

This heatmap is difficult to see patterns in because the points are binary and
the data is sparse. `heatmaps` provides a function to smooth this data. It also
lets us resize the image so that our plots don't take ages to plot. If we plotted
every point individually, the result would be much higher resolution than could possibly
fit onscreen. `output.size` specifies the dimensions of the output image matrix.

The `method` argument specifies the smoothing method. Specifying "kernel" uses
the `bkde2D` function from the package `KernSmooth`. In this case, because we
are using binary data, this method would be chosen automatically.

```{r smoothing, fig.height=6, fig.width=3}
ta_30p_smoothed = smoothHeatmap(ta_30p, output.size=c(250, 500), method="kernel")
plotHeatmapList(ta_30p_smoothed)
```

Using PWMs instead of kmers is very similar, except we also have to specify
a minimum match score. This can either be absolute or expressed as a percentage
(see `?Biostrings::matchPWM` for details).

```{r pwm_pattern_hm, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=3}
example_data = new.env()
data(HeatmapExamples, envir=example_data)
tata_pwm = get("tata_pwm", example_data)

tata_pwm_30p = PatternHeatmap(seq_30p, tata_pwm, coords=coords, label="TATA", min.score="60%")
plotHeatmapList(smoothHeatmap(tata_pwm_30p, output.size=c(250, 500)))
```

An alternative way to visualise PWMs is to plot the score at every point, which
is what the function `PWMScanHeatmap` does. It's also useful to smooth the
output of this function, except this time, because we have continuous rather
than binary data, a Gaussian blur is used (`EBImage::blur`). Again, this would
be chosen automatically in this particular case.

Because PWMScanHeatmap can produce some very high and very low values, it's
visually often better to centre the scale around the mean value (as defined
in percentages) before plotting, rather than from 0 to 100, or just the
min/max values in the heatmap.

```{r pwm_scan_hm, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=4}
tata_pwm_scan_30p = PWMScanHeatmap(seq_30p, tata_pwm, coords=coords, label="TATA")
tata_pwm_scan_30p_smoothed = smoothHeatmap(tata_pwm_scan_30p, method="blur", output.size=c(250, 500))
scale(tata_pwm_scan_30p_smoothed) = c(40, 60)
plotHeatmapList(tata_pwm_scan_30p_smoothed, color="Spectral", legend=TRUE, legend.width=0.3)
```

## Plotting lists of plots

We have so been using `plotHeatmapList` to plot individual plots, because
it automatically controls the device for use. As its name suggests, we
can also plot lists of plots together using this function.

In order to normalise signals between heatmaps, we can specify groups
of related plots to `plotHeatmapList` which will normalise the scales
and display settings. In this example we normalise our "AT" and "CG"
plots, because these occur at different frequencies. The `groups`
parameter takes anything interpretable as a factor - just specifying
numbers is usually the easiest option.

We can specify options for all plots at once, or on a per-group basis.
This works by passing a list of options, rather than a vector. Note that
for colors (among others), a list (e.g. `list("red", "white", "blue")` has
a very different meaning to the vector (`c("red", "white", "blue")`) that
we used in an earlier example.

The resulting plots shows how "TA" and "CG" content contribute to "TATA"
binding potential, as well as promoter H3K4me3, around promoters.

```{r lists, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
cg_30p = PatternHeatmap(seq_30p, "CG", coords=coords)
cg_30p_smoothed = smoothHeatmap(cg_30p, output.size=c(250, 500))

hm_list = list(
    ta_30p_smoothed,
    cg_30p_smoothed,
    tata_pwm_scan_30p_smoothed,
    smooth(h3k4me3_30p_heatmap, output.size=c(250, 500))
)

plotHeatmapList(hm_list, 
                groups=c(1, 1, 2, 3),
                color=list("Blues", "Spectral", "Greens"),
                cex.label=list(2, 2, 1.25))
```

## Plotting to file

Heatmaps can take a long time to plot, so it is usually best to plot straight
to a file rather than to the R graphics device (although this works fine, and
is reasonably quick if you smooth the plots). The default settings for margin
sizes, text size etc. are aimed at creating plots which are around 10cm x 20cm
(per heatmap), or 4 in by 8 in, as this also looks good on the R graphics
device. 

PNG is recommended, since PDFs can end up being massive files if care is not
taken reducing the image size. When using the PNG device to produce high quality
images (which would be suitable for printing), it's helpful to set the size
in real-world units (rather than pixels) and then increase the resolution above
the default 72ppi, since this produced high-res plots without the scaling issues
than come with specifying pixel sizes.

```{r plot_to_file, eval=FALSE}
png("heatmap_list.png", height=20, width=40, units="cm", res="150")

plotHeatmapList(list(ta_30p_smoothed, cg_30p_smoothed, smoothHeatmap(h3k4me3_30p_heatmap), tata_pwm_scan_30p_smoothed), 
                groups=c(1, 1, 2, 3),
                color=list("Blues", "Spectral", "Greens"),
                cex.label=list(1.25, 2, 2))

dev.off()
```

## More Complex Plots

The examples above should give an indication of how publication quality figures can
be made from most data types and easily plotted in any format. However, `heatmaps` was
also designed to be more flexible than that, so complex, publication-ready figures can
be generated programmatically rather than painstakingly edited in Illustrator or
Inkscape. This improves redproducibility, and save a lot of time in cases where the
data change, or the same operation is carried out repeatedly.

The following example is taken from Haberle et al, 2014, Nature.

<!-- explain data -->

```{r complex_data}
zf_24h_promoters = import(heatmaps_file("24h_proms.bed"), genome=seqinfo(Drerio))
windows_24h = promoters(zf_24h_promoters, 500, 500)
windows_24h = windows_24h[width(trim(windows_24h)) == 1000]
seq_24h = getSeq(Drerio, windows_24h)
seq_30p = rev(seq_30p)
seq_24h = rev(seq_24h)
```

Since we're going to be making several `PatternHeatmap`s and smoothing them,
we first create a function to do this quickly.

```{r complex_heatmaps, width=9, height=8, warning=FALSE}
SmoothPatternHM = function(seq, pattern, ...) {
    hm = PatternHeatmap(seq, pattern, ...)
    smoothHeatmap(hm, output.size=c(200, 200))
}

hm_list = list(
    ta_30p=SmoothPatternHM(seq_30p, "TA", coords=coords),
    cg_30p=SmoothPatternHM(seq_30p, "CG", coords=coords),
    ta_24h=SmoothPatternHM(seq_24h, "TA", coords=coords),
    cg_24h=SmoothPatternHM(seq_24h, "CG", coords=coords)
)

```

We're not using `plotHeatmapList`, so our scales won't be normalised
automatically.

```{r complex_scale}
scale = c(0, max(sapply(hm_list, scale)))
for(n in names(hm_list)) {
    scale(hm_list[[n]]) = scale
}

```

We can set options for top and bottom plots separately. If we want
to pass options to a `plotHeatmap` from a list (rather than typing
them out in the function call), we must pass all available options
as a list. (The function only looks at dots (`...`) if the options
argument is empty). To save us setting all the default options 
manually, `heatmapOptions` creates a full list with the specified
changes. 

Here we want the top plots to have white labels to stand
out from the background, and no x ticks since they will be present
in the bottom plot. We specify slightly larger x-axis labels than
the default.

```{r complex_opts}
upperOpts = heatmapOptions(
    label.col="white",
    x.ticks=FALSE
)

lowerOpts = heatmapOptions(
    cex.axis=1.5
)

```

We also need to specify the margins for our plots, which will be 
different depending on which part of the final image they occupy.
the total margins for each plot are the same so that each heatmap
will be the same size. 

```{r complex margins}
margins = list(
    topleft = c(0.1, 0.3, 1, 0.2),
    topright = c(0.1, 0.2, 1, 0.3),
    bottomleft = c(1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2),
    bottomright = c(1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3)
)

```

Finally we can get to the actual plotting. The layout is specified to have a narrow column on the right for a legend.

We have to set the parameters before each call to `plotHeatmap`.

Plotting additional features to the canvas is easy. The coordinates in use are
calculated as follows:

1 sequence or window in the original heatmap is one unit along the y axis.

1 bp in the original sequence or windows is one unit along the x axis.

The bottom left corner is (0, 0), so to label a particular window on the y axis
the reverse index `(nseq - index)` is used, and for bp along the x axis are
calculated from `-coords(hm)[1]`.

`par(xpd=TRUE/FALSE)` is used to allow plotting of the colored triangles outside
the normal plotting regions, and has to be reset otherwise the reference lines
at x=0 will be plotted outside the canvas as well. 

```{r complex_plot, fig.height=8, fig.width=9, fig.keep="last"}
layout(matrix(c(1:3, 1, 4, 5), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE), width=c(0.25, 1, 1))

par(mai=c(3, 0.7, 3, 0.05))
plot_legend(scale, options=upperOpts)

par(mai=margins$topleft)
plotHeatmap(hm_list$ta_30p, options=upperOpts)
par(xpd=TRUE); points(470, 8480, pch=25, cex=2.5, lwd=2, bg="blue"); par(xpd=FALSE)

par(mai=margins$topright)
plotHeatmap(hm_list$ta_24h, options=upperOpts)
par(xpd=TRUE); points(550, 8480, pch=25, cex=2.5, lwd=2, bg="red"); par(xpd=FALSE)

par(mai=margins$bottomleft)
plotHeatmap(hm_list$cg_30p, options=lowerOpts)
mtext("Distance to maternal CTSS (bp)", side=1, line=3, cex=1.2)

par(mai=margins$bottomright)
plotHeatmap(hm_list$cg_24h, options=lowerOpts)
mtext("Distance to maternal CTSS (bp)", side=1, line=3, cex=1.2)
points(c(680, 860), c(7000, 7000), pch=8, lwd=3, cex=2.5)

```

Et voila! A full figure for a paper produced entirely from R.
